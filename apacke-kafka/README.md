# Kafka App

## Description

Apache Kafka Repository (Backend)

## Configure /etc/hosts

The communication between the applications takes place directly through the machine's network.
For this it is necessary to configure an address that all Docker containers can access.

Add to your /etc/hosts (for Windows the path is C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts):
```
127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal
```
On all operating systems it is necessary to open the program to edit *hosts* as Administrator of the machine or root.

## Run the application

Run the commands:

```
docker-compose up
```

When stopping Kafka containers, remember before running **docker-compose up**, run **docker-compose down** to clean up the storage, otherwise it will throw an error when up again.
